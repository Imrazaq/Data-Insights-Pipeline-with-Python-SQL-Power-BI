# Data-Insights-Pipeline-with-Python-SQL-Power-BI
Engineered an end-to-end data analytics pipeline leveraging Python, SQL, and Power BI to extract, process, and visualize key e-commerce performance indicators
Introduction
In the world of data engineering, real-time pipelines are often spotlighted — but batch ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflows are just as critical. In this project, I walk you through how I took raw e-commerce sales data, cleaned and structured it using Python and SQL Server, and finally visualized key insights with Power BI.

This article is ideal for aspiring data engineers who want to build an end-to-end project with practical tools.
