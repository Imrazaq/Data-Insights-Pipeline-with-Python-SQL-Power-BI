# Data-Insights-Pipeline-with-Python-SQL-Power-BI
Engineered an end-to-end data analytics pipeline leveraging Python, SQL, and Power BI to extract, process, and visualize key e-commerce performance indicators
# Introduction
In the world of data engineering, real-time pipelines are often spotlighted — but batch ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflows are just as critical. In this project, I walk you through how I took raw e-commerce sales data, cleaned and structured it using Python and SQL Server, and finally visualized key insights with Power BI.

This article is ideal for aspiring data engineers who want to build an end-to-end project with practical tools.

## 1. Project Goal and Scope
⁍ Clean and prepare raw data for analysis

⁍ Create a data warehouse using dimensional modeling (star schema)

⁍ Build an ETL pipeline in Python

⁍ Visualize the data in Power BI

⁍ Deliver business-ready insights

## 2. Technologies Used
‣ Python

‣ Microsoft SQL Server

‣ Power BI

‣ CSV file as data source

In this article, I have built an end-to-end ETL process on an e-commerce dataset. We extracted data with Python, cleaned it, loaded it into SQL Server, and then created our dimension and fact tables to make it analyzable.ETL processes are one of the cornerstones of the data world.
